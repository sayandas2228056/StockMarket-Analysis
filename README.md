This project involves the development of an interactive web application designed to track and analyse stock performance.
The application enables users to monitor stock prices, observe changes over time, and manage a personalized watchlist, all
within a user-friendly and dynamic interface.
• Features:
• Watchlist Management: Users can add or remove stocks from a watchlist, displaying key information such as
stock symbol, company name, and current stock price, with real-time updates on stock performance.
• Search and Filtering: A search bar allows users to quickly find specific stocks by name or symbol. The search
results are displayed in a table with details like stock name, value per share, and performance metrics.
• Detailed Stock Reports: Clicking on a stock provides detailed information, including the current price and
percentage change, allowing for easy analysis of stock performance.
• Interactive User Interface: The application features a sleek, dark-themed interface with modern design
elements, including hover effects and dynamic animations, enhancing user interaction.
• Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, offering a consistent user experience across various
devices and screen sizes.
• Technical Details:
• Front-End: Built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling (including dark mode, hover effects, and animations
inspired by the Ducati website’s colour scheme), and JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content management.
• Data Handling: The application uses mock data to simulate real-time stock information. JavaScript functions
manage data operations, including updating the watchlist and handling user interactions.
Conclusion: This project demonstrates proficiency in modern web development techniques, showcasing a functional
and aesthetically pleasing tool for stock market analysis. The focus on user experience, interactivity, and responsive
design makes it a practical example of building robust financial analysis tools.
